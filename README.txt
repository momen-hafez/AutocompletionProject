
to run the project you have to connect to python server using the command
python -m http.server 8080 
then you should type in the browser
localhost:8080\index.html
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
our devices wasn't good enough to run two deep learning models, so we reduced 
the dataset size in a way that can make our devices train the model properly
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Once you open the local host, you should load both the dataset, and the tokenizer attached with the source code, if you click on the train button our program will start training again, but we don't need that, the model is already loaded on the server to be used by the program.

we do all our best in this project, and we hope you to like it
Regards.
